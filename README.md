## Details

This app, compatible with iPhone, is a React Native version of [Stock-List iOS Client](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-ios).<br>

This app uses the [Lightstreamer Client Library - Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lightstreamer-client-web) to handle the communications with Lightstreamer Server. A simple user interface is implemented to display real-time market data for ten stocks generated by a feed simulator.<br>
